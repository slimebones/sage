# Sage

Better personal workspace.

I develop this project just to suit my needs. Configuration is at minimal, many things are going to be hardcoded.

## The Problems

1. Most software development tools are slow, overcomplicated, but still missing the required for me features or implementing them incorrectly.
2. Wide range of tools required in daily development tasks, switching slows down.

## The Solutions

1. One workspace with buffers serving various purposes.
2. Easy switching between buffers.
